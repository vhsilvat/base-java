	/*
	 * WHAT IT IS?
	 * IoC refers to transferring of the control of objects and their dependencies
	 * from the client (main program) to the container or framework.
	 * It's a design principle, not a design pattern or a programming language
	 * feature.
	 * Spring framework is a example of an IoC container that manages the lifecycle
	 * of objects and their dependencies through XML configs, Java Annotations or
	 * Java code.
	 *
	 * WHAT IS DEPENDENCY INJECTION?
	 * Dependency Injection is a design principle that allows us to decouple the
	 * dependencies of a class from the class itself. It's a kind of implementation
	 * of the IoC concept.
	 *
	 * HOW IT WORKS?
	 * Instead of creating objects inside other object with the new keyword, we can
	 * inject an object through the constructor of other class or setter method.
	 *
	 * WHY DO WE NEED IOC?
	 * It reduces and simplifies the code, it makes the code more readable and
	 * maintainable, and it makes the code more testable (because it decouples the
	 * dependencies from the code).
