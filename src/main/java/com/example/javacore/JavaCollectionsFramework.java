	 * Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to
	 * implement commonly reusable data structures and algorithms. This framework
	 * functions more like a library than a framework. It provides a set of
	 * classes and interfaces that can be used by other classes.
	 *
	 * The collections interfaces are the following:
	 * - Iterable
	 * - Collection
	 * - List
	 * - Set
	 * - Queue
	 * - Deque
	 * - SortedSet
	 *
	 * The collections classes are the following:
	 * - ArrayList
	 * - LinkedList
	 * - Vector
	 * - Stack
	 * - PriorityQueue
	 * - ArrayDeque
	 * - TreeSet
	 * - HashSet
	 * - LinkedHashSet
