	 * Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to
	 * implement commonly reusable data structures and algorithms. This framework
	 * functions more like a library than a framework. It provides a set of
	 * classes and interfaces that can be used by other classes.
	 *
	 * The collections interface and their classes are the following:
	 *
	 * => Collection
	 *      -> List
	 *          . ArrayList
	 *          . Vector
	 *          . LinkedList
	 *      -> Queue
	 *          . LinkedList
	 *          . PriorityQueue
	 *      -> Set
	 *          . HashSet
	 *          . LinkedHashSet
	 *          -> SortedSet
	 *              . TreeSet
	 *      -> Map
	 *          . HashTable
	 *          . HashMap
	 *          -> SortedMap
	 *              . TreeMap
